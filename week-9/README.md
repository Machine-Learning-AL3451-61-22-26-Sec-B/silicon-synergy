# Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) algorithm to fit data points. The project includes selecting an appropriate dataset for the experiment and drawing graphs to visualize the results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

You can install the necessary packages using:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Project Structure
data/: Directory containing the dataset.
scripts/: Directory containing the Python scripts for LWR implementation and visualization.
results/: Directory where the output graphs will be stored.
README.md: This file.
Instructions
1. Prepare the Data
Ensure your dataset is placed in the data/ directory. The dataset should be in a CSV format with appropriate columns for the independent and dependent variables.

2. Run the LWR Script
To fit the data points using the LWR algorithm, run the script locally_weighted_regression.py:

sh
Copy code
python scripts/locally_weighted_regression.py
This script will:

Load the dataset.
Apply the LWR algorithm to fit the data points.
Draw and save graphs visualizing the fitted curve along with the data points.
Sample Dataset
You can use any suitable dataset for your experiment. Here is a simple example of a dataset structure:

Copy code
x,y
1,2
2,3
3,5
4,4
5,6
3. Visualize the Results
The script will generate graphs that visualize the fitted curve and save them in the results/ directory.

Script Overview
scripts/locally_weighted_regression.py
This script performs the following steps:

Load Dataset: Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
LWR Implementation: Implements the Locally Weighted Regression algorithm to fit the data points.
Plotting: Draws graphs to visualize the fitted curve along with the data points.
Locally Weighted Regression Algorithm
The LWR algorithm is a non-parametric regression method that fits a model to a subset of the data points, giving higher weight to points near the target point. The weights are determined using a kernel function, typically the Gaussian kernel.

This README provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and running the LWR implementation script, including an overview of the project structure and script functionality. Adjust paths and script details according to your actual implementation and file names.
