# Clustering Data using EM and k-Means Algorithms

This repository demonstrates how to apply the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the k-Means algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a CSV file. The results of these two algorithms are compared to evaluate their performance on the given dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

You can install the necessary packages using:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Project Structure
data/: Directory containing the CSV file with the dataset.
scripts/: Directory containing the Python scripts for clustering and analysis.
results/: Directory where the output files (plots, comparison results) will be stored.
README.md: This file.
Instructions
1. Prepare the Data
Ensure your CSV file is placed in the data/ directory. The script expects a CSV file with numerical data for clustering.

2. Run the Clustering Scripts
a. EM Algorithm
To apply the EM algorithm, run the script em_clustering.py:

sh
Copy code
python scripts/em_clustering.py
This script will:

Load the dataset.
Apply the EM algorithm for clustering.
Save the clustering results and plots in the results/ directory.
b. k-Means Algorithm
To apply the k-Means algorithm, run the script kmeans_clustering.py:

sh
Copy code
python scripts/kmeans_clustering.py
This script will:

Load the dataset.
Apply the k-Means algorithm for clustering.
Save the clustering results and plots in the results/ directory.
3. Compare the Results
Run the compare_clusters.py script to compare the results of the EM and k-Means algorithms:

sh
Copy code
python scripts/compare_clusters.py
This script will:

Load the clustering results from both algorithms.
Generate comparison metrics and visualizations.
Save the comparison results in the results/ directory.
Scripts Overview
scripts/em_clustering.py
This script performs clustering using the EM algorithm (Gaussian Mixture Model) from scikit-learn.

scripts/kmeans_clustering.py
This script performs clustering using the k-Means algorithm from scikit-learn.

scripts/compare_clusters.py
This script compares the clustering results from both algorithms using metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and visualizes the clustering.

Results
The results/ directory will contain:

Plots of the clustered data.
Metrics comparing the performance of the EM and k-Means algorithms.
Visualizations illustrating the clustering results.

This README provides clear instructions for setting up and running the scripts, along with an overview of the project structure and the purpose of each script. Adjust paths and script details according to your actual implementation and file names.
