Introduction
The ID3 algorithm is a classic machine learning algorithm developed by Ross Quinlan. It builds decision trees using a top-down, greedy approach based on information gain. The algorithm selects the best attribute to split the data at each node, aiming to maximize the information gain and create the most efficient decision tree.

Installation
To use this implementation of the ID3 algorithm, you can clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/my_app-algorithm.git
Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd my_app-algorithm
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Decision Tree Classifier
You can run the ID3 algorithm implementation by executing the main.py script. This script contains a Streamlit application that allows you to upload a CSV file containing your dataset and build a decision tree classifier based on the data.

To run the application, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run my_app.py
This will launch the Streamlit application in your default web browser, where you can interact with the decision tree classifier.

Customization
If you wish to customize or extend the implementation, you can modify the Python scripts in the repository. The my_app.py file contains the core logic for building the decision tree using the ID3 algorithm. You can explore and modify this file to suit your needs.
