# Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation

This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the Backpropagation algorithm. The ANN is trained and tested on appropriate datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
1. Build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
2. Implement the Backpropagation algorithm for training the network.
3. Test the network using appropriate datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ann-backpropagation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ann-backpropagation
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

#### Training the Network

To train the ANN, run:
```sh
python train.py



Implementation Details
The ANN is structured with:

Input layer
One or more hidden layers
Output layer
The Backpropagation algorithm is implemented for training the network, adjusting the weights to minimize the error.
