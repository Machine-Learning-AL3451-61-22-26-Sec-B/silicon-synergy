# Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation

This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the Backpropagation algorithm. The ANN is tested on appropriate datasets to demonstrate its performance.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
1. Building an Artificial Neural Network from scratch.
2. Implementing the Backpropagation algorithm for training the network.
3. Testing the network using suitable datasets.

## Files in the Repository

- `ann.py`: Contains the implementation of the ANN and Backpropagation algorithm.
- `train.py`: Script to train the ANN using a given dataset.
- `test.py`: Script to test the trained ANN and evaluate its performance.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used for training and testing.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ann-backpropagation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ann-backpropagation
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

#### Training the Network

To train the ANN, run:
```sh
python train.py
```
You can specify the dataset and other parameters within the `train.py` script.

#### Testing the Network

To test the trained ANN, run:
```sh
python test.py
```
The script will load the trained model and evaluate it on the test dataset.

## Implementation Details

The ANN is implemented with the following structure:
- Input layer
- One or more hidden layers
- Output layer

The Backpropagation algorithm is used for training the network by updating the weights to minimize the error.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the ANN:

1. Prepare your dataset in `data/train.csv` and `data/test.csv`.
2. Train the network:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
3. Test the network:
    ```sh
    python test.py
    ```

## Results

After running the training and testing scripts, the performance of the ANN will be displayed, showing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
