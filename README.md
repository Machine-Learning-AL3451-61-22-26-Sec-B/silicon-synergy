Candidate Elimination Algorithm 

This Streamlit web application implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm, a machine learning algorithm used for concept learning. The app allows users to upload a CSV file containing data for the algorithm, runs the algorithm, and displays the final specific and general hypotheses generated.
How to Use

Upload CSV File:
Click on the "Upload CSV file" button.
Select a CSV file containing the data for the Candidate Elimination algorithm.

Run Algorithm:
Once the CSV file is uploaded, click on the "Run Algorithm" button.
The app will execute the Candidate Elimination algorithm using the uploaded data.
View Results:

After running the algorithm, the app will display the final specific and general hypotheses generated.
It will also show the content of the uploaded CSV file for reference.
Files Included
app.py: Python script containing the Streamlit web application code.
requirements.txt: Text file listing all the Python dependencies required to run the app.
How to Run

Install Dependencies:

Follow the instructions on the web interface to upload a CSV file and run the algorithm.
About the Candidate Elimination Algorithm
The Candidate Elimination algorithm is a concept learning algorithm used for learning from examples. It generates both specific and general hypotheses by iteratively updating them based on the training examples. The final hypotheses represent the boundaries of the concept being learned.
